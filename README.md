# vulkan-microui-sample

A Vulkan renderer for the excellent [microui](https://github.com/rxi/microui) library. In case someone needed that.

Uses [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) for TTF font loading, and [SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) for windowing and input handling. These should be added alongside the Vulkan dependencies within `external/include` and `external/lib`.
